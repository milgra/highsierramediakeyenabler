# HighSierraMediaKeyEnabler

> macOS High Sierra Media Key Enabler for iTunes/Spotify

It only works with physical buttons, won't work with the TouchBar. This small app detects if Spotify is installed and offers to switch between controlling iTunes and Spotify.

I don't have a developer certificate so trust the app when macOS asks. Feel free to compile the project yourself.
